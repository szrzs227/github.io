With the hitchhiker, which is small black box, telling you interesting thinks about nearly each place or species in the galaxy, about Arthur whos house is demolished to create space for a useless bypass, about the galaxy's president Zaphod, about the earth which is described by the Hitchhiker as Mostly harmless. Marvin is extremly intelligent, but therefore becoming paranoid because of all nonsense happening around him. On time he is called to stop a battle droid equipped with NOTHING. Sure he passed this task with success as the battle droid was crashing the bridge below him by shaking himself because of loughing extremly loud recognizing, that Marvin should stop him with nothing.
