# Marvin - a maniac android

Marvin is one of the major characters of The Hitchhikers Guide Through The Galaxy. This is a trilogy of 5 books writeen by Douglas Adams. Well, where to start? With the hitchhiker, which is small black box, telling you interesting thinks about each place and each creature in the galaxy, about Arthur whos house is demolited to make space for a senseless bypass, about the galaxy's president Zaphod, about the earth which is described by the Hitchhiker as Mostly harmless. Marvin is extremly intelligent, but therefore becoming paranoid because of all nonsense happening around him. On time he is called to stop a battle droid equipped with NOTHING. Sure he passed this task with success as the battle droid was crashing the bridge below him by shaking himself because of loughing extremly loud recognizing, that Marvin should stop him with nothing. There are many more many interesting characters you should meet. Forgot to mention Ford, Trillain, the Voggons and last but not least teh Pangalactic Thunder Gargler. Find out wwho or what is behind!
